# diep.io-clone
Hi! This is the repo for a small game project inspired by diep.io. 
Originally made for a programming test. Still a work in progress.

## Features

- Audio Source caching and bullet spawning using the Object Pooling Pattern.
- Separation of state and control classes, allowing player and AI characters to reuse code.
- Game data separated into Scriptable Objects, allowing balancing and game design and easier creation of new weapons and enemy types.

## Instructions

- WASD/Arrow Keys to Move
- Mouse to Aim and Shoot.
- Break crates to collect new weapons!
- Enemies will start spawning in a few seconds.
- Try to survive for as long as you can!
